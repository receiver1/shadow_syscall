# shadow syscalls

Easy to use syscall/import executor wrapper. Syscall is based on shellcode. Function names passed in arguments are hashed at compile-time.
Supports x86 architecture, but on x86 `.shadowsyscall()` is inaccessible.

The repository provides a convenient high-level wrapper over low-level operations, range-based enumerators for modules and their exports. Includes all `GetModuleHandle`, `GetProcAddress` implementations in a much nicer wrapper without leaving any strings in binary.
Allows calling undocumented DLL functions. Has a built-in forwarded import resolver (HeapAlloc, etc.)

### Supported platforms
CLANG, GCC, MSVC. Library requires cpp20.

> [!WARNING]
> This is currently in early stages of development and is not recommended for use. Examples of usage will appear here later.
